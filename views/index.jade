        h3 Introduction
        p.
          I work for a variety of commercial, open-source and research projects.
          With each project, I aim to maintain a balance between functionality,
          elegance and simplicity, and I enjoy the job of doing it. By the time,
          I am exploring the opportunity to work on real-time analytics,
          compiler, and cloud infrastructure.
        p.
          Feel free to have a look at my work and contact me if you think my
          expertise, experience or passion may help you.
        p.
          Thanks for stopping by!
